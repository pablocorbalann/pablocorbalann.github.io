This super small project (just an index.html file and an style file) has been created for **sharing all the links of my profile in the same webpage**. For example, instead of sharing a single link for [my GitHub](https://github.com/pablocorbalann), another for [my Twitter](https://twitter.com/pablocorbalann) etc, i can simply share [this link](https://pablocorbalann.github.io/tree)

The projects consist on a single static html page, with the following structure:

###### Note: the profile picture has to be located at assets/profile.jpeg

### Todo 
There are some things we still have to do in the project, for example:
- ~Exporting all the css properties to variables.~
- Getting the links from an external file `links.json` (probably using js).
- Creating a dark mode for the page using js and css.

###### Project under the general [repo license](../LICENSE).
